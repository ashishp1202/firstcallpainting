                All colours are available in various sheen levels, from matte to full gloss, so you can choose the finish that best suits your style. One of the most popular transformations is changing white PVC windows to Anthracite Grey (RAL 7016), particularly when paired with cream K Rend for a modern, sleek look.

                        <p class="cs-text">
                            If your PVC windows or doors are looking worn or outdated, spray painting is a quick and easy way to refresh their appearance. You can select new colours and finishes to match your personal style, creating harmony or contrast with your walls, doors, and other home elements.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="cs-topper">Increase Property Value</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Professionally spray-painted PVC windows can make your property look more modern and well-maintained, boosting its curb appeal and increasing its market value. Whether you’re preparing to sell or simply want to improve your home’s appearance, PVC spray painting is a valuable investment.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="cs-topper">Extend the Lifespan of Your Windows</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            A fresh coat of paint can protect your windows from the elements, including UV rays, moisture, and dirt, which can cause fading, cracking, or peeling over time. Additionally, paint can seal any gaps or cracks, improving the insulation and security of your windows.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="cs-topper">Save Time and Money</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Spray painting is a more affordable and time-saving option compared to replacing your windows and doors. You avoid the hassle and expense of purchasing new fixtures and paying for installation, while still achieving a fresh, modern look.

                Dimitri and Daniel completed a first rate redecoration in very quick time to a very high standard. They efficient, were tidy and a pleasure to work with and would definitely use them again.

                        Dmtri was fantastic, very reasonable price and very quick. Excellent job, can’t fault at all. Even came back to do something extra at no additional cost and to double check everything was completed. Would absolutely recommend.

                        Dmitri has completed painting our house in Chelsea. We are extremely pleased with his work and the finish result looks spot on. Dumitru kept us informed during the process and has always been polite and respectful. He looked after our property and kept it clean and tidy during the works. We have planned more work for Dmitri in the next few months. I would definitely recommend him to others
